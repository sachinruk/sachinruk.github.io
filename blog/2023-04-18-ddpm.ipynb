    "## Introduction\n",
    "It took me many hours and weeks to understand DDPM. There were many intracies to understand from the maths to the code. This blog post is meant to cover both the maths side as well as coding. Hopefully, you will not need to venture outside this blog post. I will however assume familiarity with pytorch and some **high level** understanding of a UNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get going Kudos to the [fast.ai](www.course.fast.ai) explanation of DDPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also ask you to throw away presumptions about stable diffusion. DDPM while being one of the first papers that kicked off this area of Deep Learning does not take in a text input. However, hopefully you might see how to add such conditional information as we walk through this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diffusion Models\n",
    "The whole point of diffusion models is to model the data distribution $p(x)$. This is done by transforming a Gaussian distribution **iteratively** through a neural network. This is different to GANs in that this transformation happens only once in GANs. Despite the multiple steps, the performance of diffusion models are significantly higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will step through the maths behind diffusion models. If this does not interest you, feel free to jump to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rough idea behind diffusion models is the following integral:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\int p_\\theta(x|x_1)p_\\theta(x_1|x_2)...p_\\theta(x_{T-1}|x_T)p(x_T)dx_1...dx_T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The variables $x_1,...,x_T$ are latent (hidden) variables. In the final inference we throw away these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this problem tractable we noise our input via a Gaussian distribution $q(x_t|x_{t-1})=\\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\\alpha_t)\\mathbf{I})$. These alpha values are varied between 0 and 1. As alpha is close to zero $q$ is close to the standard normal while, at 1 it is close to being deterministically equal to the previous x timestep. The following diagram below shows how adding Gaussian noise moves you closer to a standard normal distribution on the right.\n",

    "## Practical Considerations of Solving ELBO\n",
    "Firstly, we set $p_\\theta$ to be Gaussian so that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\sigma_q(t)\\mathbf{I})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu_\\theta$ is a neural network that transforms $x_t$ and we set the variance to be equal to that of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$. Note that even if $x_t$ was Gaussian $p_\\theta(x_{t-1})$ is not Gaussian. This is because $\\mu_\\theta$ transforms the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ELBO term above, for the expectation terms we simply take a monte-carlo estimate (one sample of the distribution) since the expectations are intractable. This does not detract from estimating $p_\\theta$ since we are doing *stochastic* gradient descent, and also due to the fact that these single sample estimates are unbiased. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second term, $q(x_T|x_0)$ is far enough from the original distribution that it is safe to assume that it is a standard normal distribution, and $p(x_T)$ is a standard normal by definition. Regardless, this term does not depend on $\\theta$ therefore can be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final term is the most important term and works out to optimising $\\theta$ over the following:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\argmin_\\theta\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_q^2(t)}||\\mu_q(x_t, x_0) - \\mu_\\theta ||_2^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "While we could use this loss to optimise, we will refactor further to achieve a similar yet emperically more powerful term. We can reuse $q(x_t|x_0)$ to state that,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_0 = \\frac{x_t - \\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\epsilon_0}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Substituting this into $\\mu_q$ we arrive at\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_q(x_t, x_0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}x_t - \\frac{1-\\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}\\epsilon_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Therefore if we use\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_\\theta(x_t, x_0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}x_t - \\frac{1-\\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, x_0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "we arrive at our final loss function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = \\argmin_\\theta\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_q^2(t)}\\frac{(1-\\alpha_t)^2}{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\alpha_t}||\\epsilon_0 - \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) ||_2^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It has been emperically found that we can drop $\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_q^2(t)}\\frac{(1-\\alpha_t)^2}{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\alpha_t}$ term. This term can be thought of as a weighting term over the time steps which has been deemed unnecessary. Finally, do note that the loss is with respect to $\\epsilon_0$, and not simply the scaled noise which may be much smaller in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since we have the ability to sample $q(x_t|x_0)$ directly without having to sample intermediate steps, we can take just a single sample per $x_0$ without summing the KL divergence over all time-steps as suggested. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final algorithm for DDPM can be summarised as follows. Note how for inference we have no option but to sample over all time steps.\n",

The latter takes a linear interpolation method to quadruple the number of pixels. Both methods are preceded by a `ResNetWithTimeEmbed` which does not change the height or width, but does increase/ decrese the number of channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it was possible to simply do `self.up(self.down(x, t), t)`, it made a significant difference to the loss function (which was previously struggling) to include cross connections.

    "The next step is to add these values in the buffer to the layers of the `Up` module. This is done again by the forward hook using this function: `lambda module, input, output: output + self.down_outputs.pop(-1)`. This function pops out the last layer of the buffer, but more importantly, it modifies the output. Note how this hook is registered to the `self.up.up` module. Despite not having submodules like the above `self.conv_layers`, this hook fires every time `self.up.up` is called. \n",

    "The training loop is as shown below. The most important thing to note here is how the loss is estimated. Firstly, note that we only take a batch size of time-steps instead of the full possible 1000 steps. This is depite the original loss function requiring you to sum over all timesteps. However, we can think of this is as a noisy estimate which is scaled down by a factor of $\\frac{bs}{T}$. Furthermore, the KL-divergence term is also over the expectation under $q(x_t|x_0)$. This is also ignored and only a single sample of $x_t$ is taken for each $x_0$. This is called taking a monte-carlo estimate in literature, and gives us a noisy estimate of the expectation.\n",
