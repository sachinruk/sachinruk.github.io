In this instance we generate the parameters $$\theta_k$$ from $$\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},3\mathbf{I})$$. The data is generated from $$\mathcal{N}(\theta_k,0.1\mathbf{I})$$. Where $$k$$ is the table. Table allocation is the main part of the CRP which is determined by:
$$\begin{align}
k=\begin{cases}
\text{new table } & \text{with prob = } \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+n-1}\\
\text{table k } & \text{with prob = } \frac{n_k}{\alpha+n-1}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
where $$n_k$$ is the number of customers at table $$k$$.
