    "In this blog we will explore the DDIM paper with excruciating mathematical detail. In doing so, hopefully, bridge the gap between the two papers. While knowledge of DDPM is nice to have, it won’t be necessary. I will however, make frequent references to their approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some minor points before we get into the crux of this blog:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main confusion between the two papers is the use of $\\alpha$. The $\\alpha$ used in DDIM is the same as $\\bar{\\alpha}$ of DDPM.\n",
    "- DDPM is a special case of DDIM.\n",
    "- They both have the same loss function, however, the reverse (generation) process is not the same.\n",
    "- This new generation process is what makes the inference process faster. Taking it from 1000 steps down to ~50.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the paper also discusses it’s approach in a stochastic differential equation sense, I will not go through this. I do not feel confident that I understood this aspect enough to explain. Nor do I think it’s necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as we go through the following, that the aim is to find a way to sample from our data distribution $q(x_0)$. We are not trying to find an analytical solution, nor an approximation to the actual distribution of $x_0$. We do this by introducing some latent variables $x_{1,…,T}$."

    "To solidify this idea of skipping steps, they have introduced a slightly different noising and generative framework as shown below. Note that the noising process introduced before is not equivalent to this, and no amount of marginalising latents will lead to this formulation. This is again, by construction of the latents. $\\tau$ are the skipped time steps and $t \\in \\bar{\\tau}$ is it’s complement (everything else).\n",
